Resources and links to help you make pictures with a Minox camera.
## Minox Cameras
The Minox A and Minox B cameras were made for a long time and there are quite a few about. Both of them use essentially the same lens and shutter, but the B has a built-in meter you can use to set the exposure of your pictures. There is also a Minox C but this requires a battery which can be hard to get hold of. 
## Minox Media
You can buy refilled Minox cassettes and even brand-new metal ones [here](https://mshobbies.co.uk/shop).
## Film Slicing
The Minox camera uses 9mm wide film which is not made any more. However, you can obtain a "slitter" which can slice 36mm film into two 9mm wide film strips which can be loaded into cassettes. There is a 3D printable design for a slitter [here](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4684355) or you can buy a ready made one from [here](https://www.camerhack.it/product/mnmnx/).
## Film Cassettes
Minox cassettes are refillable and can be reused many times. However, they are becomming harder to obtain as it is nearly thirty years since they stopped making them. You can get 3D printable designs for the cassette and the case from the Cassette Print folder. These print will using a 0.2mm nozzle and the printer set on the "fine print" profile. 
### Light sealing
![Light felt placement](/images/felt%20fiting.jpg)
You need to stick some self adhesive felt into the cassette slots (where the film goes into and out of the cassette) to make them light-tight. Stick the felt in the positions shown above.
## Developing Tank
You can use a Patterson Universal Developing tank with a 3D printed sprial. You can find the design for the spiral [here](https://www.printables.com/en/model/254067-minox-8x11-development-reel-paterson-fit)

have fun!
